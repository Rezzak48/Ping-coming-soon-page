# Notes for me

## Main Js : email validation

### In HTML

- 1 - ids + error msg place pre

### In Js

- 1 - function for validation + function for submitting
- 2 - simple algorithm required with if statement for each one
- 3 - Pay attention for the scopes and var declarations
- 4 - when u target an input field u traget that field.value 
``` const email = document.getElementById("email").value; ```
- 5 - regEx are really useful, like the one to check the email format
- 6 - I learn about the ```preventDefault()```, it is really useful to use it with input to prevent sending data if data wasn't correct
